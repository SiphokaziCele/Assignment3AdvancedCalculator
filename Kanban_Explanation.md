## What is a Kanban Board?

A Kanban board is a visual project management tool that helps teams track work as it moves through different stages of completion. It is based on the Kanban methodology, which aims to improve workflow efficiency by limiting work in progress (WIP) and ensuring continuous delivery.

A typical Kanban board consists of:

- **Columns** representing different stages of work (e.g., "Backlog," "Ready," "In Progress," "In Review," "Testing," "Blocked," "Done").
- **Cards** representing tasks, user stories, or issues that move across columns as progress is made.

## How My Kanban Board Works

### 1. Visualizing Workflow
The board provides a clear overview of tasks and their current status. Tasks progress through the following stages:

- **Backlog** → Tasks waiting to be worked on.
- **Ready** → Tasks ready to be started.
- **In Progress** → Tasks actively being worked on.
- **In Review** → Tasks awaiting review or approval.
- **Testing** → Tasks under quality assurance.
- **Blocked** (Custom Column) → Tasks facing obstacles.
- **Done** → Completed tasks.

### 2️. Limiting Work in Progress (WIP)
To maintain efficiency and avoid overload, a limit of 3 active tasks per column is set. This prevents bottlenecks, ensuring tasks move smoothly through the workflow. If too many tasks are in the "In Progress" column, it signals the team to finish ongoing tasks before starting new ones.

### 3️. Supporting Agile Principles
The Kanban board helps in continuous delivery and iterative development. Teams can quickly adapt to changes by rearranging tasks based on priority. Task dependencies and blockers are immediately visible, improving team collaboration.

### Example of Kanban in Action
**Scenario:**  
If a task remains in the "In Progress" column for more than 2 days, it automatically moves to "Blocked" to highlight the delay. This ensures the team addresses issues early and prevents stagnation.

## Key Benefits of My Kanban Board

- **Real-time visibility** – Team members see project status instantly.
- **Better efficiency** – Limiting WIP ensures smoother workflow.
- **Flexibility** – Tasks can be reprioritized based on project needs.
- **Faster problem-solving** – Blocked tasks are identified early.

## Customization Choices

I customized my Kanban board to better align with the specific needs of my project. Here are the key changes I made:

- **Added 'Testing' column**: This was added to ensure tasks under quality assurance are clearly tracked and managed separately from the "In Progress" column. This helps in distinguishing tasks that are actively being developed versus those that are under review for quality and correctness.
  
- **Added 'Blocked' column**: This column was introduced to highlight tasks that are facing obstacles. It ensures that any issues causing delays are immediately visible to the team so that they can be addressed promptly.

- **Included 'Ready' column**: This new column was added to separate tasks that are ready to be worked on from the ones in the "Backlog". This makes it easier for the team to pick up tasks that are fully prepared to be started.

These customizations improve the clarity of the workflow and ensure that all phases of development, testing, and review are properly tracked.
