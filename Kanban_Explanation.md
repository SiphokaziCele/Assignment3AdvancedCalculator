## What is a Kanban Board?
A Kanban board is a visual project management tool that helps teams track work as it moves through different stages of completion. It is based on the Kanban methodology, which aims to improve workflow efficiency by limiting work in progress (WIP) and ensuring continuous delivery.

A typical Kanban board consists of:

Columns representing different stages of work (e.g., "To Do," "In Progress," "Testing," "Done").

Cards representing tasks, user stories, or issues that move across columns as progress is made.

## How My Kanban Board Works
## 1️.Visualizing Workflow
The board provides a clear overview of tasks and their current status.

Tasks progress through the following stages:

To Do → Tasks that need to be started.

In Progress → Tasks currently being worked on.

Testing → Tasks under quality review.

Done → Completed tasks.

Blocked (Custom Column) → Tasks facing obstacles.

## 2️.Limiting Work in Progress (WIP)
To maintain efficiency and avoid overload, a limit of 3 active tasks per column is set.

This prevents bottlenecks, ensuring tasks move smoothly through the workflow.

If too many tasks are in "In Progress," it signals the team to finish ongoing tasks before starting new ones.

## 3️. Supporting Agile Principles
The Kanban board helps in continuous delivery and iterative development.

Teams can quickly adapt to changes by rearranging tasks based on priority.

Task dependencies and blockers are immediately visible, improving team collaboration.

## Example of Kanban in Action
Scenario:
If a task remains in the "In Progress" column for more than 2 days, it automatically moves to "Blocked" to highlight the delay.
This ensures the team addresses issues early and prevents stagnation.

## Key Benefits of My Kanban Board
a) Real-time visibility – Team members see project status instantly.

b) Better efficiency – Limiting WIP ensures smoother workflow.

c) Flexibility – Tasks can be reprioritized based on project needs.

d) Faster problem-solving – Blocked tasks are identified early.
