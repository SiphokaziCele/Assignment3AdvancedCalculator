## Traceability

The following section shows how each diagram relates to the functional requirements and user stories:

### 1. **User Registration Workflow**
- **Functional Requirements (Assignment 4):**
  - FR-002: User must be able to register by entering their details, and the system must validate the input before creating an account.
- **User Stories (Assignment 6):**
  - US-001: As a user, I want to create an account by entering my details so that I can access the advanced calculator system.
- **Sprint Task:**
  - Implement the user registration form, including input validation and confirmation email.
- **Diagram Explanation:**
  - This diagram shows the user registration process. It validates input and ensures users are registered securely. This addresses stakeholder needs for a secure sign-up process.

### 2. **Login Workflow**
- **Functional Requirements (Assignment 4):**
  - FR-001: Users must be able to log in to access the system securely.
- **User Stories (Assignment 6):**
  - US-002: As a user, I want to log in using my credentials so that I can access my personalized dashboard.
- **Sprint Task:**
  - Implement login functionality with authentication and error handling.
- **Diagram Explanation:**
  - This workflow illustrates the login process, ensuring that users can only access the system with valid credentials. It ensures security as per the functional requirements.

### 3. **Perform Calculation Workflow**
- **Functional Requirements (Assignment 4):**
  - FR-001: The system must allow the user to input a mathematical expression and display the result.
  - FR-004: The system must ensure that the input is a valid expression before evaluation.
- **User Stories (Assignment 6):**
  - US-003: As a user, I want to enter an expression and get the result so that I can perform basic calculations.
- **Sprint Task:**
  - Implement input parsing and expression validation for the calculator.
- **Diagram Explanation:**
  - The core calculation logic is demonstrated here, validating the input and ensuring only valid expressions are evaluated. This fulfills the functional requirement for basic calculations.

### 4. **Graphing Calculator Workflow**
- **Functional Requirements (Assignment 4):**
  - FR-005: The system must provide the ability to input a mathematical function and generate a graphical representation of it.
- **User Stories (Assignment 6):**
  - US-004: As a user, I want to input a function and see its graph so that I can visualize the relationship between variables.
- **Sprint Task:**
  - Implement the graphing functionality, including function parsing
