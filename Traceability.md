## Traceability

The following section shows how each diagram relates to the functional requirements and user stories:

### 1. **User Registration Workflow**
- **Functional Requirements (Assignment 4):**
  - FR-002: User must be able to register by entering their details, and the system must validate the input before creating an account.
- **User Stories (Assignment 6):**
  - US-001: As a user, I want to create an account by entering my details so that I can access the advanced calculator system.
- **Sprint Task:**
  - Implement the user registration form, including input validation and confirmation email.
- **Diagram Explanation:**
  - This diagram shows the user registration process. It validates input and ensures users are registered securely. This addresses stakeholder needs for a secure sign-up process.

### 2. **Login Workflow**
- **Functional Requirements (Assignment 4):**
  - FR-001: Users must be able to log in to access the system securely.
- **User Stories (Assignment 6):**
  - US-002: As a user, I want to log in using my credentials so that I can access my personalized dashboard.
- **Sprint Task:**
  - Implement login functionality with authentication and error handling.
- **Diagram Explanation:**
  - This workflow illustrates the login process, ensuring that users can only access the system with valid credentials. It ensures security as per the functional requirements.

### 3. **Perform Calculation Workflow**
- **Functional Requirements (Assignment 4):**
  - FR-001: The system must allow the user to input a mathematical expression and display the result.
  - FR-004: The system must ensure that the input is a valid expression before evaluation.
- **User Stories (Assignment 6):**
  - US-003: As a user, I want to enter an expression and get the result so that I can perform basic calculations.
- **Sprint Task:**
  - Implement input parsing and expression validation for the calculator.
- **Diagram Explanation:**
  - The core calculation logic is demonstrated here, validating the input and ensuring only valid expressions are evaluated. This fulfills the functional requirement for basic calculations.

### 5.Save Calculation History Workflow
- **Functional Requirements (Assignment 4):**
    - FR-006: The system must allow users to save and access a history of their previous calculations.
- **User Stories (Assignment 6):**
    -  US-005: As a user, I want to be able to view my calculation history so that I can track what Iâ€™ve done before.
- **Sprint Task:**
    - Implement a backend history feature and connect it to the user interface.
---
### 6. Export Results Workflow
- **Functional Requirements (Assignment 4):**
    - FR-007: The system must allow users to export calculation results as a PDF or CSV.
- **User Stories (Assignment 6):**
    -  US-006: As a user, I want to download my results in a readable format so that I can share or store them.
 - **Sprint Task:**
     - Implement export functionality using file generation libraries.
---
### 7. Unit Conversion Workflow

  - **Functional Requirements (Assignment 4):**
    - FR-008: The system must provide the ability to convert between different units (e.g., length, weight, temperature).

 - **User Stories (Assignment 6):**
     - US-007: As a user, I want to convert between different units so that I can complete everyday or academic tasks more efficiently.

  - **Sprint Task:**
    -  Implement unit selection, conversion logic, and error handling.
---
### 8. Advanced Functions Workflow (Trigonometry, Logarithms, etc.)

  - **Functional Requirements (Assignment 4):**
    - FR-009: The system must support advanced mathematical functions including trigonometry, logarithms, and powers.

 - **User Stories (Assignment 6):**
   -  US-008: As a user, I want to perform complex scientific calculations so that I can use the tool for academic purposes.

 - **Sprint Task:**
   - Implement advanced function parsing and integrate with the core calculation engine.
