# Advanced Web-Based Calculator

## Domain:
The calculator application falls within the **Educational/Utility Domain**. Its primary focus is to assist users with a wide range of mathematical operations, including basic arithmetic, advanced functions, and specialized operations. The tool is designed for both personal use and learning, aiding users in performing quick calculations while also offering a platform for exploring more complex mathematical concepts.

## Problem Statement:
With the increasing reliance on online tools for educational and professional purposes, users need a more advanced and versatile calculator that supports both simple and complex operations. The current solutions often lack user-friendly interfaces, do not store calculation histories, or are limited in terms of available mathematical functions.

## System Purpose:
The Advanced Web-Based Calculator aims to provide users with a rich, interactive experience for performing arithmetic, algebraic, and scientific calculations in an easy-to-use format. This calculator will support basic operations (addition, subtraction, etc.), advanced functions (exponentiation, logarithms, etc.), and optional features like calculation history storage.

## Individual Scope:
The calculator will feature:
- A web-based interface built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- The ability to handle standard and advanced mathematical functions.
- (Optional) History tracking to store and view past calculations.
- A responsive and intuitive UI design.
- (Optional) Integration with an API for extended features such as unit conversion and statistical functions.

## Feasibility Justification:
Given the increasing prevalence of web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the proposed solution can be efficiently implemented with minimal resources. Additionally, cloud services such as Firebase or MySQL provide a scalable and cost-effective way to store user history, if desired. The modular approach allows for flexible development, starting with a basic calculator and adding more advanced features as needed.
