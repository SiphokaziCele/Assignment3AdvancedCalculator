# System Requirements Document (SRD) for Advanced Calculator System

## **1. Functional Requirements**

| **ID**  | **Requirement**                                              | **Acceptance Criteria**                              |
|--------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| FR-01  | The system shall perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). | Users can enter numbers and receive accurate results. |
| FR-02  | The system shall support advanced functions (exponentiation, logarithms, trigonometry). | Advanced calculations return correct values. |
| FR-03  | The system shall allow users to store and retrieve previous calculations. | Users can view a history of their calculations. |
| FR-04  | The system shall have a clear, user-friendly interface. | Users can navigate easily without confusion. |
| FR-05  | The system shall provide a graphing feature for functions. | Users can input a function and see a plotted graph. |
| FR-06  | The system shall support unit conversions (length, weight, temperature). | Users can convert values accurately. |
| FR-07  | The system shall allow users to clear their history. | Users can reset their stored calculations. |
| FR-08  | The system shall be accessible from multiple devices. | The calculator works on desktops, tablets, and smartphones. |
| FR-09  | The system shall support keyboard input for calculations. | Users can use the keyboard to input numbers and operations. |
| FR-10  | The system shall provide error handling for invalid inputs. | The calculator prevents and warns users of errors. |

## **2. Non-Functional Requirements**

| **Category**       | **Requirement**                                      |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Usability**     | The interface shall comply with accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1). |
| **Deployability** | The system shall be deployable on Windows, Mac, and Linux. |
| **Maintainability** | The codebase shall be modular for easy updates and debugging. |
| **Scalability**   | The system shall support 1,000 concurrent users. |
| **Security**      | All user data shall be encrypted using AES-256. |
| **Performance**   | The system shall return results within 2 seconds. |
| **Availability**  | The system shall have 99.9% uptime for accessibility. |
| **Extensibility** | The system shall support API integration for future features. |

This document defines the core functional and non-functional requirements to ensure the success of the Advanced Calculator System.
