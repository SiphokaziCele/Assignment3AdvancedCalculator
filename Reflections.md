Reflection: Balancing Stakeholder Needs

Developing the Advanced Calculator System involved balancing the needs of different groups, each with their own priorities. One of the main challenges was finding the right balance between simplicity and advanced features. Students and casual users wanted an easy-to-use interface, while researchers and professionals needed more complex functions like logarithms and graphing. To solve this, I created two modes: a simple one for everyday calculations and a more advanced one for technical tasks.

Security and performance were also a concern. The IT team wanted to make sure the system kept data safe, while users cared about how fast the system worked. To address both, I used strong encryption to protect sensitive data, while also ensuring calculations were completed quickly, in less than two seconds.

Another challenge was making the system work well on different devices and handle a lot of users at once. To do this, I designed the system to adjust to different screen sizes and organized the backend so it could manage many requests at the same time.

In the end, the project showed me how important it is to keep improving the system based on feedback. By building the system in a flexible way, I made sure it could be easily updated in the future while keeping it simple, secure, and fast.

# **Reflection: Challenges in Translating Requirements to Use Cases & Tests**

Translating stakeholder requirements into use cases and test cases posed several challenges in ensuring that all functional and non-functional aspects of the Advanced Calculator System were properly covered. One key difficulty was ensuring completeness—making sure that each stakeholder concern was properly addressed in a relevant use case. While the functional requirements from Assignment 4 provided a strong foundation, defining clear preconditions, postconditions, and alternative flows required deeper analysis of how users interact with the system. Every requirement had to be carefully scrutinized to ensure that it was not only reflected in the system design but also captured in the use cases and corresponding test cases.

Another challenge was handling complex interactions between different use cases. Some use cases, such as Perform Calculation and View History, were straightforward, but others, like Graphing a Function or Exporting History, involved multiple steps and dependencies. These use cases often had a cascade effect—one action would trigger another, and it was crucial to identify and map these interactions. Ensuring that these use cases remained modular while still supporting the overall system flow was essential. For instance, the Graph Function use case required seamless integration with Advanced Functions, where users would need to access more sophisticated mathematical features. Similarly, Export History not only relied on the data in View History but also involved exporting the data in a usable format. Managing such complex interactions without introducing confusion or redundancy was one of the key challenges in both the design and testing stages.

For test cases, mapping functional requirements to concrete validation steps was critical. Writing clear expected results for each test case required thinking about not only normal user behavior but also edge cases and error conditions. Non-functional tests, such as performance under high load or security validation, were particularly challenging, as they required consideration of real-world constraints like response time and encryption mechanisms. Testing for security was also complicated, given the sensitive nature of personal data that might be processed, making it essential to test for potential vulnerabilities and ensure that all transactions were encrypted and protected.

Finally, the balance between simplicity and usability was a recurring challenge. While the system needed to support advanced mathematical functions, it also had to remain accessible to general users. This required iterative adjustments to the use cases and test cases to refine error handling, accessibility, and performance considerations. The user interface needed to be intuitive, ensuring that both novices and advanced users could interact with the system effectively. In this process, feedback from stakeholders played a crucial role in fine-tuning the design to meet their expectations while maintaining a high level of functionality.

Overall, this process reinforced the importance of structured requirement analysis, iterative design, and comprehensive testing to ensure a robust and user-friendly system.
