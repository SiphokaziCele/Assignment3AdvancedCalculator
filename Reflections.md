Reflection: Balancing Stakeholder Needs

Developing the Advanced Calculator System involved balancing the needs of different groups, each with their own priorities. One of the main challenges was finding the right balance between simplicity and advanced features. Students and casual users wanted an easy-to-use interface, while researchers and professionals needed more complex functions like logarithms and graphing. To solve this, I created two modes: a simple one for everyday calculations and a more advanced one for technical tasks.

Security and performance were also a concern. The IT team wanted to make sure the system kept data safe, while users cared about how fast the system worked. To address both, I used strong encryption to protect sensitive data, while also ensuring calculations were completed quickly, in less than two seconds.

Another challenge was making the system work well on different devices and handle a lot of users at once. To do this, I designed the system to adjust to different screen sizes and organized the backend so it could manage many requests at the same time.

In the end, the project showed me how important it is to keep improving the system based on feedback. By building the system in a flexible way, I made sure it could be easily updated in the future while keeping it simple, secure, and fast.
