Introduction

    Project Title: Advanced Calculator System
    
    Domain: Education & Productivity
    
    Problem Statement:
    The current market has basic and scientific calculators, but users need a web-based version that is accessible anywhere and provides extended functionalities such as history tracking, 
    unit conversions, and graphing capabilities.
    Individual Scope (Feasibility Justification):
    The system will be a lightweight web application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It will store previous calculations and allow users to perform advanced operations. The 
    feasibility is high because:
        JavaScript can handle arithmetic operations efficiently.
        The system does not require high computational power.
        Web-based calculators are widely used for learning and work purposes.
